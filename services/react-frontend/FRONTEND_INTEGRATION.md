# Frontend Integration Setup

## Install Dependencies

First, navigate to the React frontend directory and install the new dependency:

```bash
cd services/react-frontend
npm install react-router-dom@^6.8.0
```

## Features Added

### 1. **Element Repository Integration**
- New `/elements` route with full Element Repository management
- Search, filter, and browse elements with live filtering
- Create new elements with version management
- Approve/reject element versions with workflow
- Repository statistics and performance metrics

### 2. **Enhanced Navigation**
- Modern navigation bar with route highlighting
- Server status indicator in navigation
- Responsive design with smooth transitions

### 3. **API Integration**
- Full MCP server integration with authentication
- Error handling with detailed error messages
- Element Repository CRUD operations
- Repository statistics and performance monitoring

### 4. **Component Architecture**
- Modular component design with styled-components
- TypeScript interfaces for all Element Repository types
- Comprehensive form validation and error handling

## API Endpoints Connected

The frontend now connects to these MCP server endpoints:

- `POST /tools/create_element` - Create new elements
- `POST /tools/add_element_version` - Add element versions
- `POST /tools/approve_element_version` - Approve versions
- `GET /tools/search_elements` - Search and filter elements
- `GET /tools/get_repository_stats` - Repository statistics

## Usage

1. **Start the MCP Server** (if not running):
   ```bash
   cd services/python-ai
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd services/react-frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access the Application**:
   - Main Application: http://localhost:3000
   - Test Planner: http://localhost:3000/ 
   - Element Repository: http://localhost:3000/elements

## Element Repository Features

### Search & Browse Tab
- Search elements by name with live filtering
- Filter by element type (button, input, link, etc.)
- Filter by approval status (pending, approved, rejected)
- View element versions with confidence scores
- One-click approval for pending versions

### Create Element Tab
- Create new elements with primary selectors
- Add alternative selectors for robustness
- Set confidence scores and descriptions
- Automatic form validation

### Statistics Tab
- Repository overview (total elements, versions)
- Pending approvals count
- Performance metrics (lookup time, cache hit rate)
- Most used elements ranking

## Authentication

The frontend automatically includes Bearer token authentication:
```
Authorization: Bearer demo-token
```

This matches the MCP server's authentication middleware.

## Next Steps

1. Install the react-router-dom dependency
2. Start both services (MCP server and React frontend)
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/elements to test Element Repository
4. Create test elements and verify the workflow

The integration is complete and ready for testing!
