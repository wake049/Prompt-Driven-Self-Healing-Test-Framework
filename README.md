# Prompt-Driven Self-Healing Test Framework

A modern test automation framework that converts natural language prompts into executable test plans using AI-powered planning and self-healing capabilities.

## 🎯 Overview

This capstone project demonstrates an innovative AI-powered approach to test automation by training and deploying a **Natural Language Understanding (NLU) model** that converts human language into executable test plans.

### **Core AI Innovation:**
- **Intent Classification Model**: Custom-trained scikit-learn pipeline using TF-IDF + Linear SVM
- **Natural Language Processing**: Converts plain English prompts into structured test actions
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: End-to-end training, validation, and deployment workflow
- **Intelligent Test Generation**: AI-driven mapping from user intent to executable test sequences

### **Key AI Components:**
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorization with n-gram analysis for text understanding
- **Multi-class Classification**: 4-category intent classifier (LOGIN, OPEN, VERIFY_TITLE, UNKNOWN)
- **Model Persistence**: Trained model deployment via joblib serialization
- **Hybrid Intelligence**: ML-first approach with rule-based fallback for robustness

## 🧠 AI Model Architecture

### **Machine Learning Pipeline**
```
Input Text → TF-IDF Vectorization → Linear SVM → Intent Classification → Action Generation
    ↓              ↓                    ↓              ↓                ↓
"login"     → Feature Matrix    → Model Prediction → "LOGIN"    → Test Plan JSON
```

### **Trained AI Model Specifications**
- **Algorithm**: TF-IDF + Linear Support Vector Machine
- **Features**: 70 unique n-gram features (1-2 grams)
- **Categories**: 4 intent classes with 100% training accuracy
- **Deployment**: Serialized model (`intent_model.joblib`) loaded at runtime
- **Performance**: <100ms prediction latency

### **AI Training Dataset**
```
Intent Category    | Sample Prompts                    | Training Examples
LOGIN             | "login", "sign in", "log in"      | 4 samples
OPEN              | "open example", "visit URL"       | 4 samples  
VERIFY_TITLE      | "verify title", "check title"     | 3 samples
UNKNOWN           | "book hotel", "purchase insurance" | 2 samples
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Java 11+ (for test runner)
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wake049/Prompt-Driven-Self-Healing-Test-Framework.git
cd Prompt-Driven-Self-Healing-Test-Framework
```

### 2. Start with Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Build and start all services
docker compose up -d --build

# Check service health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### 3. Local Development Setup
```bash
# Set up Python environment
make setup

# Run tests
make test

# Start development server
make dev
```

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Basic API Usage

**Health Check:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

**Generate Login Test Plan:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/plan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "login to the application"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "actions": [
    {"name": "open_url", "params": {"url": "https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login"}},
    {"name": "type_css", "params": {"selector": "#username", "text": "tomsmith"}},
    {"name": "type_css", "params": {"selector": "#password", "text": "SuperSecretPassword!"}},
    {"name": "click_css", "params": {"selector": "button[type='submit']"}},
    {"name": "wait_for_css", "params": {"selector": "#content"}},
    {"name": "assert_title_contains", "params": {"text": "The Internet"}}
  ],
  "meta": {"prompt": "login to the application", "version": "0.1.0"}
}
```

### Supported Prompts

| Prompt | Generated Actions |
|--------|------------------|
| `"login"` | Complete login flow with credentials |
| `"open example"` | Navigate to example.com and verify |
| `"verify title"` | Assert page title contains expected text |
