# Executive Overview

## Prompt-Driven Test Automation Platform

This platform transforms natural language test descriptions into executable test automation through an intelligent MCP-based architecture. The system combines LLM-powered test planning with a human-curated Element Repository, enabling organizations to achieve 90%+ automation coverage while maintaining test reliability through continuous self-healing and human oversight.

The architecture centers on four core pillars: (1) **MCP Server** providing standardized tool interfaces for test generation, execution, and healing; (2) **Element Repository** with versioned, human-approved locators and intelligent AI proposal workflows; (3) **Policy Engine** enabling dynamic test branching based on runtime conditions; and (4) **Self-Healing Infrastructure** that automatically adapts to UI changes with sub-second response times. This design eliminates traditional test maintenance overhead while ensuring enterprise-grade reliability, security, and auditability through comprehensive logging, RBAC controls, and performance SLAs.
